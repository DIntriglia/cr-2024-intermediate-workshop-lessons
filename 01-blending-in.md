# Module 01: Blending in with the surroundings: dynamic text, dark mode, and more

### Goal

Let's make our app feel more cohesive with the operating system by respecting the user's visual settings, including light/dark mode and font scaling.

### Concepts

- Using font scaling whereever we can without breaking the UI and selectively turning it off for text where it doesn't make sense.
- Refactoring a component library to implement a separate dark mode theme.

### Features to build

- Support for font scaling
- Switch to dark mode based on the user's operating system settings
  - Also allow overriding of the OS theme setting for the app
- Add haptics give our app a more tactile feel
