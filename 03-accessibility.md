# Module 03: Accessibility Timebox

### Goal

How much of our developer profile form can we make accessible before lunch?

### Concepts

- Experience your form with Talkback / Voiceover
- Use accessibility features so the inputs are clearly identified as the user scrolls down the screen and changes focus

<!-- Talkback / Voiceover work in emulators/simulators, right? Is it better to focus on devices here? -->

### Features to build

- Make the text fields accessible, facilitatng smoothly navigating through them using voice feedback.

### Resources

- Add any helpful links here

# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Font scaling that looks good!

## Exercise 2: Accessible textboxes

## Exercise 3: Making other fields accessible

<!-- Feels like a stretch, but would at least like to speak to it even if we don't have time -->

## Side Quests

- Add any extra stuff to do here
