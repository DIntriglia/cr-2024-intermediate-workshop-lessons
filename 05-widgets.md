# Module 05: When an icon isnâ€™t enough / Widgets :yellow_heart: apps

### Goal

Learn how to use config plugins like `react-native-android-widget` and `expo-apple-targets` to extend our app far beyond its screens and icon, creating homescreen widgets that read data from our app.

### Concepts

- Making a widget available for Android and iOS when your app is installed
- Sharing data with that widget
- Light widget design and styling

### Features to build

- Android: a widget that scrolls through recent podcast episodes, letting you tap an episode and navigate to it.
- iOS: a widget that shows X episodes based on its size (TODO: what are the limits of showing data on an iOS widget? I don't think they can scroll)
